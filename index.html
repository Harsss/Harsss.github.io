          There are several reasons why a medical expert system is needed:
          <ul>
            <li> <b> Expertise:</b> Medical expert systems can provide access to a wide range of medical knowledge that
              may not be available to individual healthcare professionals. This can be particularly helpful in cases
              where a healthcare professional is not an expert in a particular area or is unfamiliar with the latest
              research and guidelines.
            </li>
            <li> <b> Speed</b> Medical expert systems can process and analyze large amounts of data quickly, allowing
              healthcare professionals to make informed decisions more efficiently.
            </li>
            <li> <b> Market Size:</b> Our service is currently focused on the hospitals and clinics in Mohali, but
              following deployment and evaluation of the results, it may also be applied on a much larger scale. The
              doctors or nurses that are eager to learn more with little difficulty would be our ultimate clients. It
              will be able to support less experienced doctors and aid them in making well-informed decisions.</li>

          To reach our goal, we discussed the topic with Professor Sunita Chauhan and developed a preliminary outline for addressing the issue. The outline is as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Firstly, go to little clinics of Mohali and ask them about about their isssues and their specific needs
            </li>
            <li>
              Then we start contact with field experts and discuss with them about the feasible solutions 
              in that domain
            </li>
            <li>
              Then we collect the data in order to make accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations. This data may include medical records, research studies, guidelines, and other relevant information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then we develop the knowledge base taht consists of the information and rules that the system uses to make decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then our EMS process the data and information in its knowledge base in order to make accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations
            </li>
<li>
  Then we validate our EMS with the expert doctors
</li>
<li>
  Then we finally deploy it after the proper testing
</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

          The Benefits of our EMS are the following:
          <ul>
            <li> Improved accuracy: benefits of using medical expert systems will help to eliminate errors by using
              algorithms and data from medical literature to make suggestions with improved accuracy of diagnosis. </li>
            <li>Enhanced productivity and quick results: Medical expert systems can swiftly evaluate vast volumes of
              data and offer recommendations, which can save medical professionals time and allow them to use their
              resources more effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhanced decision-making: Medical expert systems can provide a range of treatment options and help medical professionals weigh the pros and cons of each option, which can improve decision-making and lead to better patient outcomes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Since no one is already operating at this size with such accuracy, our approach is initially targeted at small-scale doctors in Mohali's and its bordering localities. It will be useful to assess the outcomes of a particular community or society to see the trends of a particular disease throughout a certain period time.
